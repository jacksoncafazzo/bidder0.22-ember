### Description

Bidder is a website that connects people looking for someone to perform an odd job with those offering their skills nearby. Bidders can post a job, or offer services. Bidder is geared towards those looking for independent contracts to complete tasks large or small, for fair pay.

This is the second incarnation of Bidder, where we further developed the app, bringing it closer to a production level web app where data is stored, users can create profiles and user authentication exists through social networking sites.
